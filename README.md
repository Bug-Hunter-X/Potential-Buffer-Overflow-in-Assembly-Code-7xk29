This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short piece of assembly code.  The `bug.asm` file contains the vulnerable code. The `bugSolution.asm` demonstrates a corrected version with bounds checking.  Understanding this simple example can help prevent similar errors in more complex assembly programs.
